# Countdown timer from freeCodeCamp challenge

This project was made as part of passing freeCodeCamp's Front End Develpment Libraries. You can find the objectives [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-25--5-clock).

The finished project is [here](https://www.zuzana-n.cz/FCC-timer).

## Stack

I used React and SASS (specifically SCSS) to complete this project.

## Functions

The user can select how much time they want the session and the break to last. The timer starts when the user presses the play button and then can pause it if necessary. The reset button will set everything to default. When the timer reaches 00:00, a beep sound will be played, letting the user know that break or session ended.

## What I've learned

Mostly how to make a countdown clock using JavaScript. I also practiced my knowledge of React (functional programming) and SASS functionalities.

## Challenges

Mostly just breaking something that worked with some new feature :D.
